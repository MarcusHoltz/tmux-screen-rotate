# tmux-screen-rotate
## Welcome to my Tmux window shuffle repo.

These scripts present examples of how a TTY1 screen can be used (or over SSH) to visualize data and rotate through these windows.

I have included detailed install examples, you just need to decide:

* * *

### [root-install](root-install/)

Are you going to run this as root, and just use a user to execute all the commands? If so this folder is for you!

### [user-install](user-install/)

Do you need to run this as a local user? Great! The functionality is the exact same!
